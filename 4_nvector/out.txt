QUESTION 6
If static in foo() is removed, the pointer to array vanishes.
a[2] = 2
QUESTION 7
Malloc seems to already invoke static.
note malloc is void* wich takes in size_t types.
in function bar() the malloc is cast to double*b[2] = 1
QUESTION 10
double (*f)(double) = sin; f(1) = 0.841471 
double (*g)(double) = &sin; g(1) = 0.841471
Appereantly both notations are valid!
f(1) = 0.841471, (*f)(1) = 0.841471
someone made sure these two calls behave the same...

Main.c is running just fine.
printing v before setting values = [0, 0, 1, ]
printing v after setting values = [3, 4, 8, ]
printing w after setting values = [14, 13, 11, ]
(*v).data[1] = 4
dot product v and w = 182
vector v and w are equal (1) or not (0): 0
printing v before adding w = [3, 4, 8, ]
printing v after adding w = [17, 17, 19, ]
printing v after substracting w = [3, 4, 8, ]
printing v after scaling with 5 = [15, 20, 40, ]
printing v after zeroing values = [0, 0, 0, ]
printing w after zeroing values = [0, 0, 0, ]
vector v and w are equal (1) or not (0): 1

Question 6
variable passed in, only a copy.i=1
Pointer passed in, change 1-->0 takes effect.i=0
pointer passed in, i becomes the NULL pointer.i=1
In fact only the value of the pointer is sent to the function and not the pointer itself.
 the function should be void f4(int **p){*p = NULL;}
 and calling it with the address &-operator like f4(&&p).
i = 1 was >>NOT<< a NULL pointer
Somehow this is not true for my compiler...

EXERCISE KOMPLEX:
testing komplex_add...
komplex_add (1,2)
komplex_add (3,4)
a= (1,2)
b= (3,4)
a+b should be   (4,6)
a+b actually is (4,6)
